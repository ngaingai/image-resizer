# Batch Image Resizer

Takes a folder
Scans through the folder and all sub-folders
Finds and resizes all images (keeping aspect-ratio) according to desired dimension
Outputs all resized images into new folder with source folder tree intact

## Getting Started

From command line:
python batch_image_resize.py [/source_directory/] [resize_width] [resize_height]

Important: Input '0' for resize_width if you want to resize according to height

Example:
python batch_image_resize.py /my_photos/ 0 512

Will resize all images to a height of 512.
